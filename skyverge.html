<h1>Hi! I'm Ben Umali.</h1>
<br>
<h2>Where are you located?</h2>
<p>I'm currently located in sunny West Covina, CA.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why are you looking for a new position?</h2>
<p>Experience is valuable. While I have learned quite a bit working on my own, I feel working for 
SkyVerge will provide me with things I could use more of: community, a company vision and technical know-how. </p>
<br>
<h2>Can you summarize your remote work experience?</h2>
<p>In the past two years, I have done some simple freelance work from the comfort of my home. Most contacts I built for only see me through webcam or hear me on the phone.</p>
<p>As for recent work, I worked with a company called FiveStars Loyalty doing B2B sales. Most of the job was "essentially" remote. We had a morning conference call, then we'd work alone, including making cold calls.</p>
<p>I'm also rocking a two monitor desktop setup with an HD cam and SnowBall Microphone for crisp audio/video quality!</p>
<br>
<h2>What should we definitely look at in your resume/work experience?</h2>
<p>I interact(ed) with customers/clients frequently. FiveStars gave me good insight into customer service and account management in the small business market. If there was a software/hardware issue I was the first point of contact for the Greater Los Angeles Area.</p>
<p> At Vivint, I spent time training and teaching sales, however, this taught me to learn a vast amount about a product and be able to relay it to both customer and representative.</p>
<br>
<h2>What’s not on your resume/work experience but you think we should know?</h2>
<p>I built a very simple <a href="kalesagrill.com">Wordpress and Woocommerce website</a> for a business owner in the LA area this year. Like most of the freelance work, he was a family friend referral, so he also asked me to do the maintenance/hosting of his website.</p>
<p>I'm finishing up a course on Ruby on Rails, building a simple web app called "Bitter" a sort-of twitter clone.</p>
<br>
<h2>Can you summarize your HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge?</h2>
<p>I am self-taught and confident in HTML/CSS and have developed several websites from scratch. I feel that I have intermediate knowledge with Javascript, however, and most of the scripts I've included have been snippets from other developers. I am working to a point where I can develop natively with the language.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role?</h2>
<p>As a Customer Support Specialist, I feel that I can confidently answer, assist and support customers using the interpersonal skills I've gained in sales, as well as the technical knowledge I have been gaining in my freelance work. I'm very comfortable working at home (desktop setup) and I'm also not afraid to travel. I know how to engage customers and appeal to both the "frustrated, angry" customer and the pleasant ones. </p>
<p>Most importantly, I believe that this is a strong opportunity to gain a lot of technical know-how in the industry that I don't quite have the skills for (the bootcamp sounds like a great opportunity), while working for a growing company and supporting myself. I want to (someday) be employed as a Web Developer and I feel that Sky Verge can be a great middle point for me into the web development industry.</p>
<br>
<h2>Anything else we should know about you?</h2>
<p>I was in sales for 6+ years and I loved it, but ultimately felt that it wasn't the right fit for me.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Part 3: A Day in the Life </h1>

<h2>Pre-Sales</h2>
<p><i>I’m considering switching to Product Customizer. Does your app allow live image previews?</i></p>
<p>Customer,</p>
<p>Thanks for considering Product Customizer!</p>
<p>Currently, our app does not allow live image previews. We do apologize for that.</p>
<p>This is a great idea, however, and we have had other customers request this same feature. I will make sure to pass this along to our development team, we do appreciate your feedback.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any other questions! </p>

<h2>Fire Alarm</h2>
<p><i>Imagine you’ve just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take?</i></p>
<p>If the issue from the distraught customers is widespread and something I'm not able to fix, I would quickly escalate to the development/support team to let them know and figure out what steps are necessary. In the meantime, I would go through every email and reply with quality responses. I would validate each of their concerns, ask them to see what problems they are facing, and help them with any potential fixes.</p>


<h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
<p><i>We’d like to get an idea of how you explain concepts and processes. What was the last thing your purchased online? Tell us, step-by-step, how you went about searching, choosing, and completing your purchase.</i></p>

<p>Recently I decided to buy a low-budget mechanical keyboard. I'm subscribed to an online enthusiast community called Massdrop that always promotes mechanical keyboards, so I decided that I would take the plunge and get a started mech keyboard.</p>
<p>The mechanical keyboard community is very passionate, so it is easy to get caught up in the many different arguments about switches, lighting and so on..</p>
<p>I decided I would scour the web for deals on Mechanical Keyboards and from there base my decision on reviews of the keyboard from the community. Most high ratings are derived from the type of switches the keyboard uses. From Cherry switches to Blues or Browns, there are many variations. I wanted keys that were heavier and produced the "clicky" sound. Most importantly, I wanted a keyboard that was minimalistic and not flashy. </p>
<p>After compiling a list of deals on Slickdeals, I wanted to find a keyboard within the $30-50 range, that had an average of 3.5/5 stars and was generally recommended by the community. I went to Youtube, searched for the keyboards I had my eye on and listened to the sound the keyboards made. Next I listened to the reviewer to see what they thought about the ergonomic feel of the keyboard: is it comfortable, is the distance natural, does it fatigue the reviewer easily, etc..</p>
<p>Finally, after watching a several videos on the different keyboards and ghosting, I came to a decision on my first budget keyboard. I settled on a Full Size Blue Switch Mech Keyboard from Monoprice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, now that I have this keyboard, I'm already looking at more expensive and quality keyboards. I can see why so many people are passionate about them!</p>
