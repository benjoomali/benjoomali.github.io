<h1>Hi! I'm Ben Umali.</h1>
<br>
<h2>Where are you located?</h2>
<p>I'm currently located in sunny West Covina, CA.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why are you looking for a new position?</h2>
<p>Experience is valuable. While I have learned quite a bit working on my own, I feel working for 
SkyVerge will provide me with things I could use more of: community, a company vision and technical know-how. </p>
<br>
<h2>Can you summarize your remote work experience?</h2>
<p>In the past two years, I have done some simple freelance work from the comfort of my home. Most contacts I built for only see me through webcam or hear me on the phone.</p>
<p>As for recent work, I worked with a company called FiveStars Loyalty doing B2B sales. Most of the job was "essentially" remote. We had a morning conference call, then we'd work alone, including making cold calls.</p>
<p>I'm also rocking a two monitor desktop setup with an HD cam and SnowBall Microphone for crisp audio/video quality!</p>
<br>
<h2>What should we definitely look at in your resume/work experience?</h2>
<p>I interact(ed) with customers/clients frequently. FiveStars gave me good insight into customer service and account management in the small business market. If there was a software/hardware issue I was the first point of contact for the Greater Los Angeles Area.</p>
<p> At Vivint, I spent time training and teaching sales, however, this taught me to learn a vast amount about a product and be able to relay it to both customer and representative.</p>
<br>
<h2>What’s not on your resume/work experience but you think we should know?</h2>
<p>I built a very simple <a href="kalesagrill.com">Wordpress and Woocommerce website</a> for a business owner in the LA area this year. Like most of the freelance work, he was a family friend referral, so he also asked me to do the maintenance/hosting of his website.</p>
<p>I'm finishing up a course on Ruby on Rails, building a simple web app called "Bitter" a sort-of twitter clone.</p>
<br>
<h2>Can you summarize your HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge?</h2>
<p>I am self-taught and confident in HTML/CSS and have developed several websites from scratch. I feel that I have intermediate knowledge with Javascript, however, and most of the scripts I've included have been snippets from other developers. I am working to a point where I can develop natively with the language.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role?</h2>
<p>As a Customer Support Specialist, I feel that I can confidently answer, assist and support customers using the interpersonal skills I've gained in sales, as well as the technical knowledge I have been gaining in my freelance work. I'm very comfortable working at home (desktop setup) and I'm also not afraid to travel. I know how to engage customers and appeal to both the "frustrated, angry" customer and the pleasant ones.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I believe that this is a strong opportunity to gain a lot of technical know-how in the industry that I don't quite have the skills for (the bootcamp sounds like a great opportunity), while working for a growing company and supporting myself. I want to (someday) be employed as a Web Developer and I feel that Sky Verge can be a great middle point for me into the web development industry.</p>
<br>
<h2>Anything else we should know about you?</h2>
<p>I was in sales for 6+ years and I loved it, but ultimately felt that it wasn't the right fit for me.</p>
<br>
<h1> Thank you for your consideration! </h1>
